## Software Showcase

***

* What is data sketching?
  - why it's good for genomics

* Histosketching
  - indexing, clustering and ML
  - HULK, BANNER & THOR

* MinHash and LSH Forest
  - variation graphs
  - GROOT, BABY-GROOT & WASP!

----

"[Data sketching](https://github.com/will-rowe/genome-sketching) produces an approximate answer based on a summary of the data. Following its processing, data is dropped and is no longer accessible"

---

* Genomic research has a '[big data]()' problem
  - collections of genomic data continue to grow
  - certain questions don't scale
    - finding frequent items
    - counting distinct elements
  - requires large time/compute resources

* Rather than bigger computers, what can we do?
 - reduce the data
 - approximate the data
 - streamline data processing

---

* [Data sketching]() can enable microbiome analytics
 - can process data streams in small, fixed memory
 - only needs a single pass of the data
 - probabilistic but with error bounds

* Recent sketching tools using MinHash ( e.g. [mash](), [sourmash]()) are great!
 - find similar genomes
 - find what's in your microbiome sample
 - get distances to build quick trees

* There are some drawbacks, especially for microbiome analytics
 - MinHash doesn't include k-mer frequency information during sketching
 - MinHash doesn't account for impact of relative set size

* [Histosketch]() algorithm
  - designed for similarity comparisons of customer activity information
  - implemented here to process streaming k-mer spectra

* Uses [consistent weighted sampling]()
 - keeps track of k-mer frequency information
 - accounts for differences in relative set size

* Several applications
  - sample dissimilarity estimation
  - rapid microbiome catalogue searching
  - classification of microbiome samples in near real-time

* Microbiome samples from different body sites (CAMI project)

* Histosketched 48 samples in [1m30s]()

* Histosketches cluster by body site using Jaccard similarity

---

* Index the sketches using LSH Forest scheme

* Indexes are updatable

* Index searches predominantly return samples from same body site

---

* Multi-class and binary classification of microbiome samples

* Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Naive Bayes (NB)

----

* [Resistome profiling]() can be difficult
 - high similarity between reference genes
 - microbiome data can be massive in size
 - existing workflows are complicated

* Existing tools aren't ideal
 - few tools are designed for microbiome samples
 - reference dependent vs. independent
 - slow and/or inaccurate

* Variation graph encoding of sequences
 - use graph traversals to identify variants
 - collapses similar sequences
 - improves speed and accuracy

### Indexed variation graphs: [indexing]()

***

* A gene database is clustered, then converted to variation graphs

* Graph traversals are windowed and decomposed to k-mer sets

* A [MinHash sketch]() is kept for each window of a graph traversal

---

***

### Indexed variation graphs: [seeding]()

***

* Query reads are quality checked, trimmed and MinHashed

* The read sketch is queried against the index using additional [Locality Sensitive Hashing]()

* Seeds are determined using ranked [Jaccard Similarity]() estimates

![groot-figure-1b]({{site.url}}/slides/slide-data/iror/figure-1b.png)

---

***

### Indexed variation graphs: [aligning]()

***

* Assumption: majority of reads do not contain novel SNPs or errors

* Hierarchical local alignment
 - exact match > shuffled seed > gapped-end alignment

* Score traversal to classify an alignment (unique, perfect etc.)

* Single blaSHV (blaSHV-11) gene present at day 7 post initial antibiotic treatment

*  Multiple blaSHV variants present at day 18 post initial antibiotic treatment

* Graph bubbles correspond to variant nodes that bring additional extended-spectrum beta-lactamase activity to blaSHV (e.g. blaSHV-40)

---
