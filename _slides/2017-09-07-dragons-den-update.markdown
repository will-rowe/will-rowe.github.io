## Antibiotic resistance and the environment

***

* Antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue
  - Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) can be vertically and horizontally transmitted
  - acquisition of ARGs by pathogens has serious implications for treatment and prevention of bacterial infections

* Human and animal effluents contribute to environmental reservoirs of ARGs <sup>[1](http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/73/7/1541)</sup>

* Metagenomics is well suited to ARG detection
  - circumvents need to culture / design detection panel
  - can resolve and quantify full-length ARGs <sup>[2](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133492)</sup>

Are human and animal effluents impacting ARG abundance within a river catchment?

## Dragons Den proposal

***

* Sample a river catchment at 1km intervals, upstream and downstream of effluent entry points

* Prepare shotgun metagenomic libraries from each sample

* Use published method to determine relative abundance of ARGs throughout river catchment <sup>[1](https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkx017)</sup>

## Current project status

***

* Sequencing data received last month

* Quality-checked and queued to run the analysis pipeline

* New considerations

---

### New considerations

***

* Library amplification

* Combining with isolate data

* New methods for ARG detection
