## Overview

`BANNER` is a tool that lives inside [HULK](https://github.com/will-rowe/hulk) and aims to make sense of **hulk sketches**. At the moment, it trains a [Random Forest Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) using a set of labelled **hulk sketches**. It can then use this model to predict the label of microbiomes as they are sketches by ``HULK``.

For example, you could train `BANNER` using a set of microbiomes from patients that either have or haven't received antibiotic treatment. You can then use `BANNER` to predict whether a new microbiome sample exhibits signs of antibiotic dysbiosis. I will post more information and examples soon...

## Installation

### Bioconda

```bash
conda install banner
```

#### Pip

```bash
pip install banner
```

## Quick Start

`BANNER` is called by typing **banner**, followed by the subcommand you wish to run. There are two main subcommands: **train** and **predict**. This quick start will show you how to get things running but it is recommended to follow the [HULK documentation](http://hulk-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

```bash
# Train a random forest classifier
banner train -m hulk-banner-matrix.csv -o banner.rfc

# Predict the label for a hulk sketch
hulk sketch -f mystery-sample.fastq --stream -p 8 | banner predict -m banner.rfc
```


## Notes

* only supports 2 labels at the moment

* there is very limited checking and not many unit tests...
