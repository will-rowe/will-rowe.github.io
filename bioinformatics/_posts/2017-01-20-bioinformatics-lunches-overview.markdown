title:  "Bioinformatics lunches - overview"

We've started to run a weekly bioinformatics lunch at the IIB. The aims are to:

 * help each other with bioinformatics problems we are having

 * discuss new papers / software that we find useful or interesting

 * take it in turns to lead training in coding / software / methods

 * have lunch

Everyone is welcome, if you're starting out with bioinformatics or have been plugging away at it for a while. Please get in touch so that we can add you to the mailing list.

At the moment we are alternating each week between learning Python and giving talks on the methods surrounding our work. We welcome suggestions for what to cover each week - send us an email!
