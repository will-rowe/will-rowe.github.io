## Aims of these slides

***

* introduction to genome variation

* short read alignment

* interpreting alignments

* calling variants

----

##Â Introduction

***

**genome variation** = differences in DNA content / structure between two organisms

---

### Why look at variation?

***

* allows us to study evolution

  - phylogenetics

  - population genomics

* let's us make genotype / phenotype associations

  - genome wide association studies (GWAS)

  - human disease, agriculture, genetic engineering

---

### What is variation?

***

* Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)

  - a genetic "typo" of one nucleotide (e.g. A > G)

* INsertion / DELetions (INDELs)

  - a string of one or more nucleotides that has been added/removed from a location in a genome (typically 1-100bp)

* Structural Variants (SVs)

  - a region of DNA that has been inverted / translocated / duplicated (typically >100bp)

* Mobile Genetic Elements (MGEs)

  - insertion / replication of retrotransposons, transposons, integrons etc.

---

### How do we identify variation?

***

* Assembly and comparative genomics (eg. BLAST / ACT) good for identifying SVs and MGEs

* Comparison of sample DNA to a reference allows identification of variation at a given genomic position

* Sequencing reads from a sample are **aligned** against a reference genome

* A **pileup** of the reads is essentially a sample of all the alleles present in the sampled cell population

  - greater sequencing coverage = bigger sample size = greater certainty in variant calls

  - considerations must be made for ploidy, sequencing quality / errors etc.

## Short Read Alignment

***

* To call variants in a sample, we need to align sequencing reads to a reference genome

* As discussed in previous lectures, we may have millions of short reads and a large reference genome (millions / billions of nucleotides)

* How do you align reads on this scale, in a reasonable amount of time / memory whilst allowing for inexact matching / errors?

* Other considerations also include: appropriate reference genomes, orientation / pairing of reads, multiple matching

* Short read alignment is hard as the shorter the read, the less likely a unique match to the reference

---

Computationally, exact matching is relatively easy:

```
READ 1:         ATTCTTTACGACGAGTG

REFERENCE:      AGCGTGACATTCTTTACGACGAGTGATATTCTGTAATAT
MATCH:                  *****************
```

***

Inexact (fuzzy) matching is much harder:

```
READ 2:         ATTCTGTAAGAC

REFERENCE:      AGCGTGACATTCTTTACGACGAGTGATATTCTGTAATAT
MATCH:                  *****G**A***       *********G*C
```

---

### Short Read Alignment

***

* There is an important distinction between read **mapping** and read **alignment**

  - mapping is to quickly determine the best locations in the genome that a read could align

  - alignment is to determine the best per-base alignment of a read to each possible mapping location in the genome

* Short read alignment is **global** with respect to the read and **local** with respect to the reference

  - ideally the whole read matches one location in the reference genome

  - in reality, repeats, variation and sequencing error add complexity

---

### Approaches to short read alignment

***

* A brute force approach would involve looking at every position in a reference for a possible query match

  - this is not efficient

  - indexing the reference so we know where possible matches occur improves the efficiency

* Hash-based indexing

  - hashing of either the sequencing reads or the reference genome

* Indexing of trie structures

  - utilising a reference index that is derived from a trie data structure

---

### Hash-based alignment

***

* Reads or reference sequence split into k-mers

* A hash function is used to convert k-mer strings to integers

* The integers are used as an array index for fast searching of the query sequence(s)

![hash-table](http://everythingcomputerscience.com/images/phone_book_HashTable.jpg)

---

### Hash-based alignment

***

* Once the index has been built, the query is split into k-mers

  - lookup query k-mer locations in the reference via the index

  - for each query, select the reference location with most k-mer hits and perform Smith-Waterman alignment of read/reference (dynamic programming)

  - this is the **seed** and **extend** principle

* The MAQ and SHRiMP short read aligners are based on this approach

  - hash index the reads, scan using the reference sequence and use mapping quality scores to determine best alignments

  - allowing seed mismatches and a spaced-seed approach is used to improve seed-matching sensitivity

---

---

### Hash-based alignment

***

* Hash-based approaches have some downsides

  - static table means resizing can be costly - bad for a dynamic reference

  - search performance reduces when reaching table capacity

* Majority of modern short-read aligners are **suffix/prefix trie**-based aligners

  - main advantage over hash-based is that alignment of identical sequences is only done once

  - memory footprint can also be much lower than hash-based approach

---

### Indexing of trie structures

***

* A trie is a computational data structure

  - advantages of this structure include: fast lookup, no need for hash functions, no key collisions

* For short read alignment, the trie structure holds all the suffixes of a reference sequence as an index

  - one trie node per common suffix

  - this enables fast string matching (query look up)

---

![trie-structure](http://marknelson.us/attachments/1996/suffix-trees/FIGURE1.gif)

* Example suffix trie for the text BANANAS

  - all suffixes of BANANAS are found in the trie

  - search for substrings by starting at the root and following matches down the tree until exhausted

  - the paths of this trie can be compressed by removing nodes with single descendants

---

### Algorithms based on suffix/prefix tries

***

* these algorithms find exact matches and build inexact alignments (supported by the matches)

* to identify exact matches, the algorithms use a representation of the suffix/prefix trie

  - E.G. suffix tree, suffix array, FM-index

  - a special terminal character ($) is used to denote the end of the suffix

  - FM-index is widely used due to it's small memory footprint

Suffix Trie ----- Suffix Tree ----- Suffix Array ----- FM Index

---

### The FM-index

***

* The FM-index is used by short read aligners such as Bowtie and BWA

* To understand how the FM-index is queried during read alignment, let's first look at the **Burrows-Wheeler Transform**

* The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) was originally a method to improve algorithmic efficiency of text compression but is widely used in bioinformatics software

---

### The Burrows-Wheeler Transform

***

* for a given reference sequence, T

* get all rotations of T

* form the Burrows-Wheeler Matrix (BWM)

* sort the BWM lexicographically

* the last column of the sorted matrix is the BWT of the reference, i.e. BWT(T)

---

![BWM-1](http://homolog.us/Tutorials/Tut-Img/Set6/BWT3.png)

* get all rotations of the string "homolog.us"

---

![BWM-2](http://homolog.us/Tutorials/Tut-Img/Set6/BWT4.png)

* sort the BWM lexicographically and look at the last column

---

### The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)

***

* The BWT of a string allows for efficient compression

  - runs of the same character can be condensed

  - this is what computing tools such as bzip2 are based on

  - the BWM is not stored - only the BWT is used

* The BWM resembles the suffix array

  - sorted order is the same, regardless if using rotations or suffixes

  - this means, rather than finding all rotations, we can generate BWT(T) by:

```python
if SA[i] > 0:
  BWT[i] = T[SA[i] - 1]
if SA[i] == 0:
  BWT[i] = $
```

BWT = the characters one to the left of the suffixes in suffix array

---

### The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)

***

* The BWT is reversible - you can get the original reference sequence back

* For this we utilise the **Last-to-Front** (LF) mapping property

* This property means that the order of characters in the first column is the same as that of the last column

* Let's look at the homolog.us BWM example with all O's coloured by occurrence

---

![BWM-3](http://homolog.us/Tutorials/Tut-Img/Set6/BWT6.png)

![BWT-1](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cole_Trapnell/publication/24177230/figure/fig3/AS:267670977249315@1440829142907/Figure-1-Burrows-Wheeler-transform.png)

---

### The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)

***

* Now that we have seen:

  - how to perform the BWT

  - how BWT can be used to compress a string

  - how BWT can be reversed

* How is it used as an index in short read alignment?

  - the **FM Index** allows for this and is based on BWT

---

### The FM Index

***

* Stands for Full-text Minute-space

* FM index combines BWT with a few additional data structures

  - checkpoints and a suffix array sample

* Querying the FM index is based on the LF property

  - the LF function matches character and rank

  - this can be used to reconstruct T from BWT(T) or to query the reference

  - the FM index stores extra information to facilitate this calculation

---

### The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)

***

* We have seen how the FM index can be used to find exact sequence matches

  - requires small amount of memory

  - short read alignment needs allowances for mismatches and read quality etc.

  - solutions such as backtracking quality-aware searching facilitate this

* For more information on BWT, [this](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~langmea/resources/lecture_notes/bwt_and_fm_index.pdf) lecture series by Ben Langmead is highly recommended

* For how it is implemented in short read aligners, [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2943993/#!po=25.0000) review and [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3997) paper are good resources

## Alignments

***

* Now that we know the basic principles behind short read aligners, let's go over the alignment results

* There is a single unified file format for storing read alignments to a reference genome called **SAM** format

* SAM stands for Sequence Alignment Map

  - there is a binary version of this file format: **BAM**

  - BAM allows for fast processing/indexing of the alignment

  - there is also **CRAM** format (not discussed further) that offers reference-based compression

* We will explore the SAM format during the practical and use **samtools** to get basic alignment statistcs, as well as manipulate and convert alignment files

---

### Alignment Post-processing

***

* Sorting, filtering and indexing the alignment

  - speeds up downstream analysis and reduces file size

  - can be done using piped commands (holding alignment in memory)

* Local realignment

  - InDels can cause reads not to align correctly

  - multiple sequence alignment is performed in suspect alignment regions

* Duplicate removal

  - duplicate reads may be PCR artifacts and these need to be marked/removed so that variant call is not biased (reduces false positives)

* Base quality score recalibration

  - per-base recalibration uses reported quality score, read position and dinucleotide context

---

### Variant Calling

***

* To call variants from a pileup of reads, we generally use a probabilistic method (e.g. Bayesian model)

  - tools such as Freebayes, GATK HaplotypeCaller, Samtools/BCFtools and Varscan are commonly used

* These programs calculate **genotype likelihoods** at each base position

  - variants can be called relative to multiple samples

* Mapping quality, base quality and read pair information etc. is utilised in making the calls

* Variant calls are contained in a Variant Call Format (VCF) file

---

### Variant Filtering

***

* Once we have a VCF file, we apply filtering to reduce false positives

* We can filter using criteria such as depth, variant frequency, strand balance

* We could also use information on known variants to recalibrate our variant quality scores

* Once filtered, we should interpret our results and then see if we need to reapply the filters

  - check SNP density, transition/transversion ratio etc.
